    <h1>Recpie for lasagna</h1>
    <img src="lasagna.jpeg">

    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of
        changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk
        added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an
        authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil
        it</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>
            ground pork
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Bechamel sauce:</h3>
        <li>
            unsalted butter
        </li>
        <li>
            gluten-free all-purpose baking flour
        </li>
        <li>
            whole milk
        </li>
        <li>
            ground nutmeg
        </li>
        <li>
            salt
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot,
            celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5
            minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7
            minutes more
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat
            to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth
            only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.
        </li>
    </ol>
